Piano Feature:
    The toy created in this project acts like a piano where you can use the 4 buttons on the display to play diffrent keys.
    The specific keys from lefct switch to right are "D", "E", "F#", "A".
    These are the notes that make up the song "Marry Had A Little Lamb".
    
Song Feature:
    While it is not debugged, there is a function to play "Marry Had A Little Lamb" while a key is not being pressed. 
    //Im not sure why the funciton doesnt work, what is currently happening is that the first note of "Marry Had A Little Lamb" is being played but is not ncrementing through each note.

Assembly: 
    I have implemented the project/button_P2/SingleLightHandler/LED.c into assembly
